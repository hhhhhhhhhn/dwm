# dwm build

This build of dwm has the swallow, focusmaster and movestack patches, and some manual modifications for hiding the borders on the monocle layout and removing the top bar entirely (instead of just hiding it). Also, the tags are configured in a more traditional "workspace" way, each one of them having their own layout, which includes the '0' tag.
